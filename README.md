In the picture provided above, the variables/coefficients P-values Pr(>|t|):

Vehicle length:              2.06e-12

Vehicle weight:              0.0776

Spoiler Angle :              0.3069

Ground Clearance:            5.21e-08

AWD :                        0.1852


•	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

From the dataset results, we can predict that the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD had the lowest P-values, providing a minor variance to the mpg.

•	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear cant is zero because if we look at the chart or the results, the total P-values = 5.35e-11.  So, this hypothesis should be rejected or null.

•	Does this linear model predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

According to the chart, the r squared is = 0.7149.  This means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions that used linear models are considered accurate.
